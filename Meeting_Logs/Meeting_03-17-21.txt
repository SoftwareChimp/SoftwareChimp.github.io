3/17/21:

We were finally able to resolve our issue with heroku not being able to access our repo.

We had to reconfigure our github org in order to be able to give thrid party access to Heroku.

Software-Chimp-Inc was the org that heroku was requesting access from however Software Chimp is where the repo is hosted. 

Software-Chimp-Inc was deleted and Software Chimp was made into an org and third party restrictions were lifted.
